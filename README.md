The run_analysis.R script is used to

* Merge training (X_Train.txt) and test (X_test.txt) data from a data set
* Extract measurements of mean and standard deviations from individual measurements
* Assigns descriptive activity and variable names based on the feature.txt file
* Creates a data set with these averages

The data is assumed to be retrieved from the following source:
